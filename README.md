2. Start IntelliJ IDEA.

## Features
Using MySQL **Standard Create table statement** to generate a JPA Entity.

- Generate class annotation @Entity.
- @Table(name = "table_name") that generates a class based on table name.
- Generate class comments based on table annotations.
- Generate property annotations based on column annotations.
- Generate property name based on column name, converted to small hump naming style.
- Generate property Type based on column type, in accordance with [MySQL Specification](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-reference-type-conversions.html).
- Generate @Id based on PRIMARY KEY.
- Generate @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) based on AUTO_INCREMENT
- Generate a Getter/Setter method for the property. Handling boolean type method names with variable names starting with is in accordance with [Java Bean Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19798-01/821-1841/bnbqc/index.htm).
- Generate a no-argument constructor and initialize it based on the DEFAULT value declared by Column.

## Example
MySQL **Standard Create table statement**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE `t_building` (
  `id` bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT 'Primary key ID',
  `name` varchar(50) NOT NULL COMMENT 'name',
  `sale_status` tinyint(4) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'Sales status 1-on sale, 2-for sale, 3-sales',
  `floor_space` bigint(11) DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'Site: Units of square decimeter',
  `card_date` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP COMMENT 'certification time',
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=197 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COMMENT='Property Master';
```
Be generated JPA Entity (Actually in the clipboard):
[Generated File Example](/src/test/java/TBuilding.java)

## Standard Create table statement
Can be found in a variety of MySQL clients, the following are commonly used client access methods

 - Sequel Pro: Enter the database, click on the selection table on the left, select Table Info on the menu bar on the upper right, and **Standard build statement** in the Create syntax on the right side.
My
- MySQL Workbench: Enter the database, select the table on the left, right-click the table name, select from the pop-up menu, Copy to Clipboard -> Create Statement, at this time **Standard build statement** already exists in the clipboard
- Navicat for MySQL: Enter the database, double-click to open the database, drop the left table, left click to select the table, find DDL in the upper menu on the right side and click, **Standard form statement** will appear in the right window .

The steps in the above ways are all the steps I tried to install on the mac. If it is other software, other platforms, the general approach is the same. After the table is selected, there will always be a place to display the ** standard form statement **, and you can find it.
